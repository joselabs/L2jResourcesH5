That indomitable Hermodt! The greatest Warrior of the Neruga tribe. If you are here for his remains, first you should hear his story...<br>
Hermodt was the tribal leader when he set off to kill the serpents threatening his territory. He fought bravely and at last, drove them out.<br>
Alas he was shot by a poison arrow and died immediately after killing the leader of the serpents, Queen Gorgon!  He was a true hero!<br>
