<font color="LEVEL">The Mandragora Roots</font> needed by Rouke have all been delivered in time. But unless we defeat the rebels, it will be only a stop-gap measure.<br>
I am disturbed to hear of this Bloody Axe Aide from <font color="LEVEL">Mercenary Captain Sophya</font>. I urge you to take this opportunity to strike a blow against the rebels, my lord. Then the residents of Dion will be able to conduct their trade in safety, and your rule will be secure.
