You've chosen the <font color="LEVEL">battle with Mounted Troop Great Warriors</font>.<br>
I admire your confidence! I hope you haven't bitten off more than you can chew! Whatever happens, though, I'm looking forward to an entertaining battle.<br>
Please confirm all your party members are ready. When they are, I'll teleport you to the arena.<br>
