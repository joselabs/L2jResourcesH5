An excellent idea, my lord! Their leader is <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Pinter of the Town of Gludio</font>. I'm sure he would be grateful for any assistance you can offer. In fact, you need not do it yourself. You can appoint a trusted agent to act on your behalf in this matter. Simply let me know <font color="LEVEL">whom you have chosen to Raffortysent you</font>. If he agrees and you verify his identity, I will tell him what he needs to know.
