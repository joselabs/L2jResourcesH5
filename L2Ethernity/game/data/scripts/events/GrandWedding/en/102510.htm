Hello there, I am the Grand Wedding Manager.  It is my task to allow young couples to have a Grand wedding ceremony the likes of which you have never seen before!<br><br>
The Grand Wedding is a big ceremony where all the players are invited to come and celebrate with you. The cost for such an event is 100.000.000 Of Adena, and it is paid by the first person in the couple who requests the wedding.<br><br>
Once a request is made, your future husband or wife will have 2 minutes to confirm the wedding ceremony.  If it is not confirmed within 2 minutes, the wedding is cancelled and you will loose your fee.<br><br>
Before you can get married, you need to be engaged.  To do this, make sure the person that you want to marry is in your friends list target the person and type:<br>
<font color=LEVEL>/friendinvite [nameofthecharacter]</font><br><br>  
Once he or she is on your friends list, target him/her again and type:<br>
<font color=LEVEL>.engage</font><br>
then you will be engaged and you can register for the Grand Wedding Ceremony.<br><br>
