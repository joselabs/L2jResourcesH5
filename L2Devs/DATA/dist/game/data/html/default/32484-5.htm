To begin, talk about the enemies that you meet. <font color="LEVEL">Kanabion</font> - these are not ordinary monsters.
It is a fusion of evil and darkness in one body.<br>
They use a variety of magic. We need to destroy them and prevent them from spreading around Kamaloka.<br>
If you manage to deal with monsters, we are ready to reward you for this merit. but your merit must correspond to the 5th stage <font color="LEVEL">grade S - D</font>.<br>
In addition, we can extract from them <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Canabion</font>, which will also give you. True, in the real world essence is useless...<br>
So it will be better to donate it to us. And in exchange we will issue you an appropriate reward.<br>
And remember that if you die around Kamaloka, no one can help you. You'll stay there until your time is up, or until all Kanabions disappear. This place is associated with your sleep, remember.<br>
And now the most important thing! Our technology <font color="LEVEL">allow you to be there for only 20 minutes</font>. don't forget about it either.<br>
