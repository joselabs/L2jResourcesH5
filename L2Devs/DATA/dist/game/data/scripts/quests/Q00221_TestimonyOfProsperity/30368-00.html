<html><body>Lilith:<br>
What is a Dwarf doing on this remote island? You have come to see me?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Mark of Health</font>? News has recently come of the death of my lover, for whom I have waited these thousand years...Do you feel my grief?... How could you bother me with something as trivial as a mark? Are all Dwarves like you? How could speak this way to a person in agony... You selfish, selfish Dwarf!
