Do you just ask for a date to any Elf you see for the first time?<br>
I'm sorry, but I don't have time other than magic research. I might think about it if you buy a <font color="LEVEL">rose</font> from me.<br><br>
Propose to me with a <font color="LEVEL">rose</font>. Put out a beautiful flower in front of me and shout out so all town people can hear it<br><br><br>
