<font color="LEVEL">Zaken's Curse Event</font><br>
Oh, now they've gone and done it! All the greedy people who have stolen from my grandfather's hideout through the years have finally pushed him over the edge. Just look at them! They've been turned into pigs! They should have known better, trying to steal from an all-powerful undead pirate captain and all, but I do feel a little sorry for them. Being stuck as a pig forever doesn't seem like a very happy fate (unless you enjoy mud baths).<br>
I fear what kind of retaliation this will mean for my grandfather. His temper gets the best of him, and he's a bear to deal with sometimes, but he's still family. Besides, I think the thieves have learned their lesson. Don't you? I'll tell you what, if you help me undo this mess, I'll make it worth your while. I'll even put in a good word for you with grandpa! What do you say?<br>
You'll find three different types of cursed pigs: Huge Cursed Pigs, Super Huge Cursed Pigs, and the rare Golden Cursed Pigs. Purchase a Redemption Bow and use the bow's "Forgiveness" and "Pardon" skills on the cursed pigs to free them from Zaken's Curse. When you cure a cursed pig, you'll get either Apiga or Pirate's Booty. Pirate's Booty are tiny treasure chests which may contain a valuable Golden Apiga. I'll also award you other prizes each time you turn in 50 regular Apiga. Collect as many Apiga and Golden Apiga as you can!<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Prizes & Info</font><br>
When you bring Magic Laboratory Worker Event Manager 50 regular Apiga, she'll reward you with some random prizes. If you're lucky, she may even reward you one of the following special prizes:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Gold Circlet of Redemption</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Pig Wrangler's Cap</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Silver Circlet of Salvation</font><br><br>
The players who collect the most of Zaken's most prized coins--the Golden Apiga--will also be awarded the rare First Mate's Hat!<br>
Throughout the event, you may also find a souvenir Salvation Bow. This bow looks just like the Redemption Bow used in the event, but it has a special skill associated with it called "Happiness". You can use Happiness on your friends as much as you like! Be warned that both of these bows are not meant for regular combat, and the Salvation Bow cannot be used to cure the cursed pigs.<br>
Happy cursed-pig hunting, and good luck!<br>
