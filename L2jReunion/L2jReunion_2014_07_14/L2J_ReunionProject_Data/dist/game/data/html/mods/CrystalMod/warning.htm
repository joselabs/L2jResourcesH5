<font color="LEVEL">Warning Ability:</font>
<br>
While this function is enabled, and someone will try to attack your location, each online clan member will be warned of the danger, that someone is trying to conqer your location. Its really useful option while no one is guarding your location! As always, you will have to pay for such facilities. Also remember, to prevent spam with warning messages, your clan may be warned once per one minute!<br><center>
