# Game Server Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the server configuration file. Here you can set up the connection information for your server.
# This was written with the assumption that you are behind a router.
# Dumbed Down Definitions...
# LAN (LOCAL area network) - typically consists of computers connected to the same router as you.
# WAN (WIDE area network) - typically consists of computers OUTSIDE of your router (ie. the internet).
# x.x.x.x - Format of an IP address. Do not include the x'es into settings. Must be real numbers.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Networking
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is transmitted to the clients connecting from an external network, so it has to be a public IP or resolvable hostname
# Common settings...
# 127.0.0.1 - If you are playing alone on a test server
# 192.168.x.x - This is if you are on a 192.168.x.x type network (behind a standard consumer router) and want other computers from JUST the internal network to be able to connect
# x.x.x.x - WAN IP obtained from http://www.whatismyip.com/. This is if you want people outside your internal network to be able to connect to your server.
# If this IP is resolvable by the Login Server, just leave *.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default: *
ExternalHostname = 77.49.255.152

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is transmitted to the client from the same network, so it has to be a local IP or resolvable hostname.
# This can be the internal IP such as 127.0.0.1 or the computer's IP such as 192.168.x.x.
# If this IP is resolvable by the Login Server, just leave *.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default: *
InternalHostname = *

# Where's the Login server this gameserver should connect to
# Default: 127.0.0.1
LoginHost = 127.0.0.1
#LoginHost = 127.0.0.1
# TCP port the login server listen to for gameserver connection requests
# Default: 9014

# Database
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Specify the appropriate driver and url for the database you're using.
# Examples:
# Driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver (default)
# Driver = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
# Driver = com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
Driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
# Database URL
# URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost/l2jdb (default)
# URL = jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/l2jdb
# URL = jdbc:sqlserver://localhost/database = l2jdb/user = sa/password = 
URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost/trinity_local
# Database user info (default is "root" but it's not recommended)
Login = root
# Database connection password

# Default: 100
MaximumDbConnections = 100

# Default: 0

# Misc Server Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the server ID that the Game Server will request.
# Example: 1 = Bartz
# Default: 1
RequestServerID = 1

# True = The Login Server will give an other ID to the server if the requested ID is already reserved.
# Default: True
AcceptAlternateID = True

# Datapack root directory.
# Defaults to current directory from which the server is started unless the below line is uncommented.
#DatapackRoot = C:/Users/Gamer/L2_Luna/git/repository/L2_Luna/

# Define how many players are allowed to play simultaneously on your server.
# Default: 100
MaximumOnlineUsers = 500

# Minimum and maximum protocol revision that server allow to connect.
# Warning: You must make sure that the minimum revision is always less than or equal to the maximum revision.
# Default: 83
MinProtocolRevision = 1

# Default: 87
MaxProtocolRevision = 999

# Misc Player Settings

# Character name template.
# Examples:
# CnameTemplate = [A-Z][a-z]{3,3}[A-Za-z0-9]*
# The above setting will allow names with first capital letter, next three small letters,
# and any letter (case insensitive) or number, like OmfgWTF1
# CnameTemplate = [A-Z][a-z]*
# The above setting will allow names only of letters with first one capital, like Omfgwtf
# Default .* (allows any symbol)
CnameTemplate = .*

# This setting restricts names players can give to their pets.
# See CnameTemplate for details
PetNameTemplate = .*

# Maximum number of characters per account.
# Default: 7 (client limit)
