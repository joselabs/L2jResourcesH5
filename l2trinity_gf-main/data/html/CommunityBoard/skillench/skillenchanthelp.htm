Skill Enchantment is a way of strengthening certain skills that have reached their limit. Any character who has completed the third class transfer and is at least level 76 can enchant a skill with the help of a skill trainer.<br>
When enchanting a skill for the first time, pay particular attention to the methods of reinforcement. If there are at least two, the method will be determined during the first enchantment session. Also, carefully note the descriptions of each effect before choosing.<br>
All skill enchantments have a set success rate. If enchantment fails, exp. and SP will be consumed and your skill will return to +0 status, so carefully consider the success rate carefully before attempting skill enchantment. The success rate improves as the character's level increases.<br>
Skill enchantment includes a common enchantment, safe enchantment, untrain and route alteration.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Enchant a Skill</font></center><br>
This is a common skill enchantment. If the enchantment fails, the skill is initialized.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Safe Enchantment</font></center><br>
This method is used to enchant skills more safely. Even if the enchantment fails, the skill does not initialize. Using this method requires 3 times the experience and SP as a common skill enchantment, and you must have the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Secret Codex of Mastery</font>. <br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Untrain</font></center><br>
Turns an enchanted skill back to SP. The enchantment level will drop by 1, and 80% of SP will be restored. To use this option, you must have the <font color="LEVEL">Oblivion Codex</font>. If you untrain at level 1, your skill will be initialized.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Enchantment Route Alteration</font></center><br>
This function changes the route of an enchanted skill. Based on the variable success rate, the enchanted skills will either maintain their level or drop 1-3 levels. Changing the route requires both the same amount of SP needed for gaining a level as well as 20% of experience. You must have the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Secret Codex of Discipline</font>.<br>
