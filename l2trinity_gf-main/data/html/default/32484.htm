Hail, brave adventurer! Why do look at me like that? If you hadn't slept in a week, you'd be a little less than fresh yourself! Still, better than the alternative: a nightmare from which you never awaken!<br>
Say, can you spare come change? No, not for liquor! I told you -- I'm not a drunk, I just have to stay awake. I need coffee, and I need it now! I can already feel myself starting...to...drift off...(soft snores).<br>
