Are you leaving? May the blessing of the shining stars be upon your travels...<br>
Hmm... By your look, I am not sure that you have enjoyed your stay in Heine. Innadril is the most beautiful city in Aden. However, if you have not seen the fleets of merchant ships coming in at the turn of the tide, or have not heard the wind playing the fields of reeds like an army of dancing flutes, I urge you to delay your departure. What say you?<br>
