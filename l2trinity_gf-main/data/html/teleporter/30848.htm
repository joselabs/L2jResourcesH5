<html><body>Gatekeeper Elizabeth:<br>
I am Gatekeeper Elizabeth, one of the guardians sent by the Ivory Tower to protect the doors of space and time. I know that Aden is reputed to be a center of politics, culture and religion, but my task of sending people to destinations far from here keeps me far too busy to explore this place as I would wish. Ironic, eh?<br>
