<html><body>Gatekeeper Esmeralda:<br>
I hear that there are many monsters wandering around Hunters Village. For travelers who do not wish to risk encountering them, we gatekeepers may open the door of space and time.<br>
Do you miss your hometown? Are you in a hurry to rescue a friend? Or do you have a sudden urge simply to see the ocean? In the blink of an eye, we can send you wherever you wish upon this wide continent.<br>
