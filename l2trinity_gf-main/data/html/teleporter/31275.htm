<html><body>Gatekeeper Tatiana:<br>
I am pleased to meet you! I am Tatiana, a Goddard Gatekeeper. I control the door of space and time, which can allow you to move long distances in a flash. To learn its use fully, you would need years of training in the Ivory Tower, just as I had. <br>
Well! Have you decided where you would like to travel?<br>
