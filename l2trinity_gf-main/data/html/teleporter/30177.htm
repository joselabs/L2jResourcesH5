<html><body>Gatekeeper Valentina:<br>
Yes? I am the Gatekeeper Valentina, dispatched from the Ivory Tower located to the north of this village. Some believe the Ivory Tower is plotting to conquer the world; others see it only as an asylum for magically-inclined lunatics. Of course, there are also a few people who believe the Tower holds the key to mankind's ultimate salvation...<br>
Perhaps you too have an opinion on the matter, eh?<br>
