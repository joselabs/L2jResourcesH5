As you approach this apparition you feel an overwhelming sense of rejuvenation...<br><br>
Rebirthing will set you to level 92, with all skills, PvP/Pk points, subclasses intact.
It will grant your main class a +1 stat point from each stat (<font color="FFFF00">Str, Dex, Con, Men if you are a fighter. Int, Wit, Men or Con if you are a mage.</font>) permanently.<br>
<font color="99CCFF">(maximum of 4 rebirths, on main class only)</font><br>
<font color="8080FF">You will need:<br>
 -At least level 94<br1>
 -Be on your Main Class.<br1></font>
<br>
<font color="2291FF">After Rebirth:<br>
-Level set to 92<br1>
-Ultimate Skills still useable<br1></font>
<br>
When you are ready and wish to begin at level 92 again with +1 to a stat point, click the button below.
