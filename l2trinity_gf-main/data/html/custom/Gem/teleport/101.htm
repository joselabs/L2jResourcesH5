Obtaining gifts to donations (via PayPal) to our server is fully automated through this NPC. Information of each donation is automatically sent by PayPal to this NPC. After your donation, you will receive an automated email from our server with a transaction ID#. When you enter this transaction ID# at this NPC, this NPC will add to your character's inventory the number of Donation Tokens corresponding to the USD$ amount of that donation.<br>
Each $1 = 1 token. All donations are purchased solely with the donation tokens (Step 3). Therefore, it is not necessary to include additional info such as 'desired donation gifts', 'character name', etc and not necessary to contact any GMs.

Click the 'donate' button from the Donation post on the forums, or manually donate via PayPal to . It is recommended to browse the donation shop (Step 3) to see the cost of items before donating.<br>
After the donation is completed, copy down the transaction ID# from a email you will receive (NOT the ID# PayPal gives you on the receipt page). It'll look something like #5CU06251S5639471W (This is a randomly-generated fake ID# for example purposes).<br>

To receive your donation tokens, simply go to Step 2 and type in your transaction ID# in the box provided and click 'Confirm'. Remember that you can either include or ignore the pound (#) sign when entering the ID, also, the transaction ID# is NOT case-sensitive.<br>
The Donation Token is not manipulateable through any other means other than this donation NPC. It cannot be dropped, sold, traded, or destroyed. The only way to remove them from the server is to spend them at this NPC's donation shop.<br>

Donated items purchased via donation tokens, if otherwise tradeable, will not be tradeable for 6 weeks beginning at the purchase time. After such time, the server will not be responsible for lost donation items due to PK drops and/or scams.<br>
Some donation items are potion-like useable items that affects your character in a way, such as leveling you to Lv 90, or increasing PvPs. Remember to use them on the correct/desired subclass, if applicable.<br>The prices as well as availability of donation reward items are subject to change at anytime without prior notice.<br>

Monetary contributions is vital to ensure the continuity and continued-updates of our community. The donations you make go beyond simply paying for the server and web-hosting costs; and should be viewed as more meaningful than just a way of 'buying items'. Developing an entire game server requires tremendous time and energy and your donations keep our server and the staff here going. No donation is too small, and none are unappreciated.<br>

As always, thank you for your support.
