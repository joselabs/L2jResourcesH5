<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Burang:<br>
Nice to meet you. I am Burang, a member of the local fishing guild. Some of my friends say I'm a walking dictionary of fishing; my wife just says I'm a fishing fanatic. Decide for yourself!<br>
I can teach you, step by step, the many fishing skills you'll need as well as provide you with fishing-related products. Ah, and I can also adjust the fish you caught, so remember that.<br>
