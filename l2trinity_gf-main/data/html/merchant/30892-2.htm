<html><body>Trader Enverun:<br>
Its formal name is the Aden Trade Guild. It has jurisdiction, at least in theory, over the whole kingdom. As you know, the kingdom's economy is controlled by the Dwarves. Lacking a voice, the Human merchants finally united to form the guild.<br>
Actually...I was just told that I need to join as well... But I honestly don't want to. The Dwarven Guild has done well for all of us for a long time. Even when individuals have disputes with each other, the current system allows them to still do business. But if the new guild has its way, how will the traders in Giran and Innadril work together when all they can do is growl at each other... That's my opinion, at least!<br>
