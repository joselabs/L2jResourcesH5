Where did you come from, youngster? What are you searching for?<br>
No, no, I'm not talking about goods... I'm wondering how you ended up here... <br>
Oh, never mind. Old habits die hard. Please don't think I'm senile just yet. Although I must admit that I may have lost my mind... At least all the goods here are normal!<br>
