<html><body>Trader Kunai:<br>
For the eternal glory of the flame! Greetings, brother of the flame.<br>
I am Kunai the weapons trader. Supplied by the Dwarves, I guarantee you that the quality of our items is without peer. True, the Dwarves deserve to be pummeled and stomped -- but they make good items, and if we don't sell their wares the Elves and Humans will. Ah, the hardships we must bear for the sake of our tribe's eternal glory! Have a look -- you won't regret it.<br>
