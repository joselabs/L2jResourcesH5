I'll give you a nice present if you can help me find some magical items I lost on my way here from the North Pole.<br>
A group of evil witches stole my <font color="LEVEL">Star Dust, Fairy Dust and Red Fairy Dust</font>. I heard they hide <font color="LEVEL">west of the Cave of Trials</font>, at <font color="LEVEL">Tower of Insolence 3rd Floor</font> and in some rooms inside the <font color="LEVEL">Forgotten Temple!</font><br>
I'll also need some change to fetch my bus back to the North Pole. Please bring me <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Prosperity</font>, which you can obtain by participating in the <font color="LEVEL">Team versus Team and Capture The Flag</font> events.<br>
Finally, if you wish to get a special present, you can fight the Bosses in the world to bring me <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Breath</font>. Look for these bosses: Betrayer of Urutu Freki (Orc Zone), Greyclaw Kutus, Breka Warlock Pastu, Karte, Barion, Longhorn Golkonda, Biconne of Blue Sky, Earth Protector Panathen, Fafurion's Henchman Istary, Storm Winged Naga, Kernon's Faithful Servant Kelone, Death Lord Ipos, Meanas Anor, Palatanos of Horrific Power, Doom Blade Tanatos, Fairy Queen Timiniel, Furious Thieles, Enchanted Forest Watcher Ruell, Paniel the Unicorn and Messenger of Fairy Queen Berun.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot. I'm collecting medals as well, so I'll trade you the presents for a <font color="LEVEL">Medal of Victory</font> in addition to the other items. :)<br><br><br>
