Welcome!<br>
An adventurer needs all sorts of necessary equipment. In the old days, I would've given you some freebies to help you out, but with so many adventurers nowadays and because I have to import the equipment from overseas, I just can't afford to do it anymore. <br>
Just remember to buy and use equipment suitable for your abilities.<br>
