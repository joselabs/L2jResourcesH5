<html><body>Magister Atraxis:<br>
I've been here for a fairly long time, but still can't abide this infernal cold! Sometimes I comfort myself with memories of the Elven Village, filled with light. <br>
And is not the light of the Elves something to be prized? My hope is that all my fellow Elves who pass by here may learn something of magic, which allows us to access the divine light of the goddess Einhasad herself... May the blessing of the Goddess of Light shine upon you all!<br><br>
