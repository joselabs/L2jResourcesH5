Horreum penesto dimaphio... Oh, my apologies -- I didn't realize you were here. There are no traditional magicians in Schuttgart, so I must travel all the way to Gludio Territory in order to study traditional magic with the proper teachers. <br>
As you probably know, the trip to Gludio is a hard one. To make the most of each trip, I study as much magic as I possibly can while there. I was there not long ago, and was just reviewing some of the incantations I learned.<br>
