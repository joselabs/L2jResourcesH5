<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Lunin:<br>
I've been in this business for 50 years, and the one thing I've learned is that wealth comes and wealth goes. For example, last year the van Halter family had a monopoly on Rune's market -- now it's controlled by the Benandanti Traders Guild.<br>
If you want to do business here, you'd best know these kind of things. Take it from me...<br>
