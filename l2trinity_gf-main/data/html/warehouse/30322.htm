<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Ballin:<br>
Welcome, youngster. You seem to be doing very well for yourself. Ever consider depositing some of your items instead of carrying them around like that man over there? He looks like a peddler! No, clearly we offer a better, safer alternative here at the Steel Gate Guild. <br>
And once you deposit an item, you can withdraw it at any of our branches! For the sake of security, of course, only the people you designate can do so.<br>
