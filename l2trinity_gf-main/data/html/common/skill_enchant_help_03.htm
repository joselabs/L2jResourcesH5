Skill enchantment includes a common enchantment, safe enchantment, untrain and route alteration.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Enchant a Skill</font></center><br1>
This is a common skill enchantment. If the enchantment fails, the skill is initialized.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Safe Enchantment</font></center><br>
This method is used to enchant skills more safely. Even if the enchantment fails, the skill does not initialize. Using this method requires 3 times the experience and SP as a common skill enchantment, and you must have the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Secret Codex of Mastery</font>. <br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Untrain</font></center><br>
Turns an enchanted skill back to SP. The enchantment level will drop by 1, and 80% of SP will be restored. To use this option, you must have the <font color="LEVEL">Oblivion Codex</font>. If you untrain at level 1, your skill will be initialized.<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">Enchantment Route Alteration</font></center><br>
This function changes the route of an enchanted skill. Based on the variable success rate, the enchanted skills will either maintain their level or drop 1-3 levels. Changing the route requires both the same amount of SP needed for gaining a level as well as 20% of experience. You must have the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Secret Codex of Discipline</font>.
