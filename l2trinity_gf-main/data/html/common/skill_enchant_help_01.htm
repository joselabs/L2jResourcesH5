Skill Enchantment is a way of strengthening certain skills that have reached their limit. Any character who has completed the third class transfer and is at least level 76 can enchant a skill with the help of a skill trainer.<br>
When enchanting a skill for the first time, pay particular attention to the methods of reinforcement. If there are at least two, the method will be determined during the first enchantment session. Also, carefully note the descriptions of each effect before choosing.<br>
All skill enchantments have a set success rate. If enchantment fails, exp. and SP will be consumed and your skill will return to +0 status, so carefully consider the success rate carefully before attempting skill enchantment. The success rate improves as the character's level increases.<br>
